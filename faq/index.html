            <!-- FAQ Item 1 -->
            <div class="faq-item space-y-4">
                <h2>What is the difference between Microblading and the Ombre Powder Brows you offer?</h2>
                <p class="text-lg text-zinc-300">This is a common and important question. We exclusively specialize in the modern Ombre Powder Brow technique because it provides safer, longer-lasting, and more beautiful results for the vast majority of clients.</p>
                <p class="text-zinc-300">In short: Microblading uses a manual blade to <strong class="text-white">cut</strong> hair-like strokes, which can be harsh on the skin and is unsuitable for many skin types. Our technique uses a specialized machine to create a series of tiny dots (pixels), resulting in a soft, shaded "powdered" look that is <strong class="text-white">gentler, suitable for all skin types, and lasts longer</strong>.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- FAQ Item 2 -->
            <div class="faq-item space-y-4">
                <h2>Does Permanent Makeup hurt?</h2>
                <p class="text-zinc-300">Client comfort is a top priority. A highly effective topical anesthetic cream is applied before and during the procedure to numb the area, significantly minimizing any discomfort. Most clients describe the sensation as minimal, similar to light tweezing or scratching. Many are so relaxed they nearly fall asleep!</p>
            </div>
            
            <!-- FAQ Item 3 -->
            <div class="faq-item space-y-4">
                <h2>Is the procedure safe?</h2>
                <p class="text-zinc-300">Absolutely. We adhere to the strictest hygiene and safety standards. Key safety measures include:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-zinc-300 space-y-2">
                    <li><strong class="text-white">Single-Use Equipment:</strong> All needles are 100% sterile, individually packaged, and disposed of immediately after each client's procedure.</li>
                    <li><strong class="text-white">High-Quality Pigments:</strong> We use only premium, certified pigments that are tested for safety and are produced to the highest industry standards.</li>
                    <li><strong class="text-white">Sanitized Environment:</strong> The treatment area and all equipment are thoroughly disinfected before and after every appointment.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <!-- FAQ Item 4 -->
            <div class="faq-item space-y-4">
                <h2>How long does the appointment take?</h2>
                <p class="text-zinc-300">A typical new PMU appointment lasts about 1 to 1.5 hours. This includes a thorough consultation, mapping and shaping the design for your approval, applying the anesthetic, and the procedure itself. The actual tattooing time is often around 30-45 minutes.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- FAQ Item 5 -->
            <div class="faq-item space-y-4">
                <h2>How should I prepare for my appointment?</h2>
                <p class="text-zinc-300">To ensure the best possible results, please follow these guidelines:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-zinc-300 space-y-2">
                    <li>Avoid caffeine, alcohol, aspirin, and ibuprofen for 24 hours before your appointment, as they can thin the blood.</li>
                    <li>Avoid sun tanning or intense sun exposure on your face for one week prior.</li>
                    <li>Discontinue use of any Vitamin A/Retinol products on the forehead, brow, and eye area for two weeks prior.</li>
                    <li>Do not wax, tweeze, or tint your eyebrows for at least 3 days before the procedure.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <!-- FAQ Item 6 -->
            <div class="faq-item space-y-4">
                <h2>What is the healing process like?</h2>
                <p class="text-zinc-300">The healing process is a journey with several stages. Right after the procedure, the color will appear darker and bolder than the final result. Over the next 7-10 days, the area will gently flake or scab. It is <strong class="text-white">critical</strong> not to pick at the flakes. Once the flaking is complete, the color may appear very light or "ghosted" for a few weeks before it blooms back to its true shade. The full, healed result is visible after 4-6 weeks.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- FAQ Item 7 -->
            <div class="faq-item space-y-4">
                <h2>How long does Permanent Makeup last?</h2>
                <p class="text-zinc-300">PMU is considered semi-permanent. It is designed to fade gracefully over time. On average, results last between 1 to 3 years. Longevity depends on your skin type, lifestyle (sun exposure is a major factor), and skincare routine. To keep your PMU looking fresh, we recommend a color boost or "renewal" session every 1-2 years.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- FAQ Item 8 -->
            <div class="faq-item space-y-4">
                <h2>Why is a touch-up (correction) session necessary?</h2>
                <p class="text-zinc-300">PMU is a two-step process. The initial session builds the foundation and shape. During the healing process, some areas may heal lighter or the color may slightly shift. The touch-up session, performed 6-8 weeks later, is where we perfect the results. We assess how your skin has healed the pigment and make any necessary adjustments to color, density, and shape to ensure a flawless and long-lasting outcome.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- FAQ Item 9 -->
            <div class="faq-item space-y-4">
                <h2>Why is permanent makeup considered an investment?</h2>
                <p class="text-zinc-300">Permanent makeup is a highly specialized craft that combines artistry with technical precision. The price reflects a significant investment in several key areas that guarantee a superior result:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-zinc-300 space-y-2">
                    <li><strong class="text-white">Advanced Training & Expertise:</strong> The price accounts for years of dedicated training, continuous education in the latest techniques, and the mastery required to create custom results for every unique face.</li>
                    <li><strong class="text-white">Premium-Quality Materials:</strong> We use only the highest quality, certified pigments and sterile, single-use needles. This ensures safety, stability of color, and beautiful, long-lasting results.</li>
                    <li><strong class="text-white">Time and Customization:</strong> Each 1-1.5 hour session is dedicated entirely to you, including a detailed consultation, meticulous design and mapping, and precise application.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="text-zinc-300">You are not just paying for a service, but for peace of mind, safety, and the expertise of a dedicated professional. It's an investment in your confidence and daily convenience that pays for itself over time.</p>
