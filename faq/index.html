                <h2>Do you offer traditional body tattooing?</h2>
                <p class="text-lg text-zinc-300">No, annae.tattoo specializes exclusively in <strong class="text-white">Permanent Makeup (PMU)</strong> services, such as powder brows, permanent lips, and eyeliner.</p>
                <p class="text-zinc-300">We do <strong class="text-white">not</strong> offer traditional body tattooing. Our techniques and pigments are specifically chosen for facial cosmetic enhancement, which differs significantly from traditional tattoo artistry.</p>

                <h2>What is the difference between Microblading and the Ombre Powder Brows you offer?</h2>
                <p class="text-lg text-zinc-300">This is a common and important question. We exclusively specialize in the modern Ombre Powder Brow technique because it provides safer, longer-lasting, and more beautiful results for the vast majority of clients.</p>
                <p class="text-zinc-300">In short: Microblading uses a manual blade to <strong class="text-white">cut</strong> hair-like strokes, which can be harsh on the skin and is unsuitable for many skin types. Our technique uses a specialized machine to create a series of tiny dots (pixels), resulting in a soft, shaded "powdered" look that is <strong class="text-white">gentler, suitable for all skin types, and lasts longer</strong>.</p>

            <div id="brow-lamination" class="faq-item space-y-4">
                <h2>Do you offer Brow Lamination?</h2>
                <p class="text-lg text-zinc-300">No, we do not offer brow lamination. Brow lamination is a popular temporary chemical treatment that helps style brow hairs into a desired shape, creating a fuller, more defined look for about 6-8 weeks.</p>
                <p class="text-zinc-300">While brow lamination offers temporary styling, many clients seeking defined and low-maintenance brows find our <strong class="text-white">Ombre Powder Brows</strong> to be a superior, longer-lasting solution. PMU provides consistently perfect, naturally shaded brows that last 1-3 years, eliminating the need for daily styling or frequent chemical treatments.</p>
                <p class="text-zinc-300">If you're looking for beautifully shaped and defined brows with minimal daily effort, we invite you to explore our Ombre Powder Brow services. It's an investment in waking up with perfect brows every day!</p>

                <h2>Does Permanent Makeup hurt?</h2>
                <p class="text-zinc-300">Client comfort is a top priority. A highly effective topical anesthetic cream is applied before and during the procedure to numb the area, significantly minimizing any discomfort. Most clients describe the sensation as minimal, similar to light tweezing or scratching. Many are so relaxed they nearly fall asleep!</p>

                <h2>Is the procedure safe?</h2>
                <p class="text-zinc-300">Absolutely. We adhere to the strictest hygiene and safety standards. Key safety measures include:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-zinc-300 space-y-2">
                    <li><strong class="text-white">Single-Use Equipment:</strong> All needles are 100% sterile, individually packaged, and disposed of immediately after each client's procedure.</li>
                    <li><strong class="text-white">High-Quality Pigments:</strong> We use only premium, certified pigments that are tested for safety and are produced to the highest industry standards.</li>
                    <li><strong class="text-white">Sanitized Environment:</strong> The treatment area and all equipment are thoroughly disinfected before and after every appointment.</li>

            <div class="faq-item space-y-4">
                <h2>How long does the appointment take?</h2>
                <p class="text-zinc-300">A typical new PMU appointment lasts about 1 to 1.5 hours. This includes a thorough consultation, mapping and shaping the design for your approval, applying the anesthetic, and the procedure itself. The actual tattooing time is often around 30-45 minutes.</p>
                <hr class="border-zinc-800 mt-12">

            <div class="faq-item space-y-4">
                <h2>How should I prepare for my appointment?</h2>
                <p class="text-zinc-300">To ensure the best possible results, please follow these guidelines:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-zinc-300 space-y-2">
                    <li>Avoid caffeine, alcohol, aspirin, and ibuprofen for 24 hours before your appointment, as they can thin the blood.</li>
                    <li>Avoid sun tanning or intense sun exposure on your face for one week prior.</li>
                    <li>Discontinue use of any Vitamin A/Retinol products on the forehead, brow, and eye area for two weeks prior.</li>
                    <li>Do not wax, tweeze, or tint your eyebrows for at least 3 days before the procedure.</li>
                </ul>

            </div>

            <div class="faq-item space-y-4">
                <h2>What is the healing process like?</h2>
                <p class="text-zinc-300">The healing process is a journey with several stages. Right after the procedure, the color will appear darker and bolder than the final result. Over the next 7-10 days, the area will gently flake or scab. It is <strong class="text-white">critical</strong> not to pick at the flakes. Once the flaking is complete, the color may appear very light or "ghosted" for a few weeks before it blooms back to its true shade. The full, healed result is visible after 4-6 weeks.</p>

            <div class="faq-item space-y-4">
                <h2>How long does Permanent Makeup last?</h2>
                <p class="text-zinc-300">PMU is considered semi-permanent. It is designed to fade gracefully over time. On average, results last between 1 to 3 years. Longevity depends on your skin type, lifestyle (sun exposure is a major factor), and skincare routine. To keep your PMU looking fresh, we recommend a color boost or "renewal" session every 1-2 years.</p>
                <hr class="border-zinc-800 mt-12">
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item space-y-4">
                <h2>Why is a touch-up (correction) session necessary?</h2>
                <p class="text-zinc-300">PMU is a two-step process. The initial session builds the foundation and shape. During the healing process, some areas may heal lighter or the color may slightly shift. The touch-up session, performed 6-8 weeks later, is where we perfect the results. We assess how your skin has healed the pigment and make any necessary adjustments to color, density, and shape to ensure a flawless and long-lasting outcome.</p>

               <h2>How does permanent makeup save me time and money?</h2>
               <p class="text-zinc-300">While the upfront cost is an investment, it provides significant returns by saving you two of your most valuable assets: time and money. Here’s how:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-zinc-300 space-y-2">
                   <li><strong class="text-white">Time Saved Daily:</strong> Imagine saving 10-15 minutes every single morning. That adds up to over 60 hours in a single year that you get back for yourself. You wake up with perfectly defined features, ready for the day.</li>
                   <li><strong class="text-white">Money Saved on Products:</strong> Consider the annual cost of brow pencils, powders, gels, eyeliners, and professional tinting appointments. A single PMU procedure, which lasts 1-3 years, can often be less expensive than the continuous cost of these products and services.</li>
                   <li><strong class="text-white">Effortless Confidence:</strong> Your makeup is smudge-proof, waterproof, and flawless 24/7. Whether you're at the gym, swimming, or caught in the rain, you can be confident that you look your best without a second thought.</li>
                </ul>
