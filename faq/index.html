            <h2>What is the difference between Microblading and the Ombre Powder Brows you offer?</h2>
            <p class="text-lg text-zinc-300">This is an excellent question. While both are forms of permanent makeup for eyebrows, the techniques and results are very different. At annae.tattoo, we exclusively specialize in the modern Ombre Powder Brow technique, as we believe it provides safer, longer-lasting, and more beautiful results for the vast majority of clients.</p>
            
            <p class="text-lg text-zinc-300">Here are the key differences:</p>

            <ul class="space-y-4 text-zinc-300 list-disc list-inside">
                <li>
                    <strong class="text-fuchsia-200">The Technique:</strong> Microblading involves using a manual blade to cut fine, hair-like strokes into the skin. In contrast, Ombre Powder Brows use a specialized digital machine with an ultra-fine needle to create a series of tiny dots (pixels), resulting in a soft, shaded, "powdered" look. This machine technique is significantly less traumatic to the skin than the cutting motion of microblading.

                <li>
                    <strong class="text-fuchsia-200">Skin Type Suitability:</strong> This is a critical factor. Microblading is often not suitable for clients with oily, porous, or mature skin, as the strokes can blur, heal poorly, or fade quickly. <strong class="text-white">Powder Brows are suitable for nearly all skin types</strong>, making them a much more reliable and versatile option.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong class="text-fuchsia-200">The Final Look:</strong> Microblading creates distinct hair strokes. Powder Brows heal to a soft, filled-in finish, similar to using a high-quality brow powder. The result is a beautifully defined brow that looks natural and polished, without the harshness of individual lines.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong class="text-fuchsia-200">Longevity and Fading:</strong> Powder Brows typically last longer than microblading. As they fade, they do so evenly and softly, simply getting lighter over time. Microbladed strokes can sometimes blur together or fade unevenly, requiring more frequent touch-ups to maintain their appearance.
                </li>
            </ul>
